# About UMDinst #

The UMD Instrumentation package (UMDInst) is a collection of wrapper programs that collect data from study participants during their programming phases. Whenever subjects are compiling or running their codes snapshots of their programs and commands are written to a local log file. At the end of the study this log file contains all intermediate versions of the whole development process of HPC programs. Beside that it is possible to calculate additional measures based on this data, e.g. effort spent for an assignment.
